# ðŸ›¹ Demo 5: Ackee's X Example 
### (Mia's quick solution)

<br>


A classical exercise for folks to learn PDAs in practice is Ackee's X App example: a program that can perform basic functions like:

- **creating tweets**, including a topic of up toÂ `32 bytes`Â and content of up toÂ `500 bytes`. The topic is the seed for this PDA (so users can have more than one tweet).
- **adding/removing tweet reactions**, covered by a new reaction account and PDA. In this case, the seeds for this PDA are chosen to prevent more than one reaction per user on a tweet.
- **adding/removing tweet comments**, including a content field (`500 bytes`) that stores the text and is used as input into the comment account PDA.
